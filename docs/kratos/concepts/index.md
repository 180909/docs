ORY Kratos is a new archetype of software we call **Identity Infrastructure Service**. Traditional identity systems - sometimes
referred to as Identity and Access Management (IAM), Identity Management (IdM), Identity Provider (I(d)P),
or IDaaS (Identity as a Service) - have several shortcomings which we'd like to explain before revealing what we have
done differently in ORY Kratos and why.

First of all, ORY Kratos solves identity on the network. It is not a on-device (think mobile phones) user database.
When we talk about web applications and identity, there is always an exchange of credentials happening:

- Username + Password -> Cookie, Token, ...
- Email + Password -> Cookie, Token, ...
- Passwordless login -> Cookie, Token, ...

Regardless of your use case (mobile, browser, native application, ...) you either use a cookie (usually when accessing
the application directly through the browser) or a token (when accessing the application using a programmatic client
via an API). While it is common - but bad practice - to use tokens for Single Page Apps (apps running on the client-side
browser), there is no real difference between these two approaches as both represent a set of credentials valid
for a certain domain or a number of domains.

So you may ask yourself: **Why the heck is everyone selling me OAuth2 and OpenID Connect?** Well, we have some assumptions
(such as selling complexity as security, and selling black boxes/closed source with open standards) but let's stay on
the positive side of things!

In any case, we will dig deeper into why OAuth2 and OpenID Connect (or "protocols looking something like
OAuth2 but actually not following spec" - looking at you AWS Cognito) are so popular amongst IaaS
(Auth0, Okta, AWS Cognito, ...).

A primary differentiator is that ORY Kratos is simple to use and does not sell complexity as security. To the contrary,
**ORY Kratos is easy to use because that removes potential configuration and implementation errors.** We reduce attack
surface by making things easy - not hard.

You can still consume OAuth2 and OpenID Connect with ORY Kratos, and you can become an OAuth2 and OpenID Connect Provider
by combining ORY Kratos with [ORY Hydra](http://github.com/ory/hydra) - but that's a topic for another time!

We try to make things as easy as possible for you, the developer - implying that we take care designing, securing,
and testing critical network flows, system architectures, user flows, protocols, and business logic.

## Approaches to solving Identity

Before going ahead let's look at the "Identity Landscape" of today. The disclaimer is probably obvious, but please take
our findings and arguments as an opinion. We do have lots of experience in this space, but every system has its use case
and place. We do want to bash other systems to gain competitive advantage, but it is important to understand what technology
to use and what drawbacks (and upsides) you get.

For a full comparison with other open and closed source systems, head over to the
[Comparison Chapter](../further-reading/comparison.md).

### Full-stack Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Full-stack IAM is sold as a one-size-fits-all silver bullet. Want to use LDAP? *No problem!* Need OAuth 2.0 and OpenID
Connect? *We support that!*

Because of their immense size and complexity, these full-stack solutions are typically written in an enterprise language
such as Java EE. They have rich feature sets that include

- theming to customize the user experience, typically constrained to the anticipated theming use case;
- HTML Template Engines specific to the language used, such Java Server Pages or [Apache FreeMarkerâ„¢](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/#html-templates);
- plugin loaders and APIs to add custom logic or even custom API endpoints, specific to the language used by the project such as
[Service Provider Interfaces](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/#_extensions);
- Load Balancers and other features you would not expect to see in a project that runs in the cloud.

But all big, full-stack software projects come with a cost:

- the software becomes rather big in terms of disk
(e.g. [~550MB for IBM/RedHat Keycloak](https://hub.docker.com/layers/jboss/keycloak/5.0.0/images/sha256-23bb12bf100c56369c77d6d2e6312b29c2f5fbea7793ff2ac250ccf645474a1a),
[up to several GBs for the full Gluu Federation Suite](https://github.com/GluuFederation/community-edition-containers)), CPU, and Memory footprint;
- while scaling and clustering (for High Availability) is certainly possible, it becomes more complex as inter-process-communication for caches
and other features is required - using protocols such as [JGroups](http://jgroups.org/);
- cold starting a process can take several minutes and have a negative impact on your availability guarantees.

Unfortunately, these types of projects are typically the product of a company building their own IAM system and selling
that or releasing it as Open Source. While the Open Source part is very noble, this approach comes with several draw-backs:

- Data models are very strict and specific to the company developing the product: 
    - You can either have a username or an email for login (but not both or unable to change it later);
    - You may define additional attributes are stored as [unstructured data](https://auth0.com/docs/users/concepts/overview-user-metadata),
        sometimes even as plain [key/value pairs](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/6.0/server_admin/#user-attributes).
- Impossible or at least very complex build pipelines when using modern frontend frameworks like React or Angular in
    the HTML Rendering engine;
- The user model stays the same, even if you want to differentiate between customers and employees in your system;
- API consumption is usually an after-thought, because most flows are built around the user doing something in the browser.
This leads to added complexity in your application as you need to deal with session management, cookie management, CSRF protection,
and other mechanisms related to identity and security.

That's enough criticism for today, so we won't go into the space of enterprise, proprietary full-stack IAM solutions
that come with $100k+ installation fees, $500k+ recurring fees and no way of knowing what goes on under the hood (for now).

For a more detailed and less opinionated comparison of the different projects and services, head over to the
[Comparison Chapter](../further-reading/comparison.md).

### Identity as a Service (IDaaS)

Several proprietary SaaS companies have established themselves over the past decade including Auth0 and Okta.
AWS Cognito and GCP CICP (Cloud Identity for Customers and Partners - it's basically Firebase on the Google Cloud Platform)
are the products provided by the big players.

Because of the nature of their product, they act as a third-party login. It's like "Login with Google" but you can
re-brand the "Google" part. Therefore, these systems typically choose OAuth2 and OpenID Connect as their primary
protocol. It fits the use case - the user logs in on a different system than your own. But are OAuth2 and OpenID Connect
really the best protocol at hand for this? Keep in mind that these protocols were designed for the "ACME Corp's Facebook
Photo Backups" and "GitHub Continuous Integrations" of the world - not for first-party login!

If you've ever used OAuth2 or OpenID Connect you probably know that it's no free lunch. As the authors of the most popular
OAuth2 and OpenID Connect server [ORY Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra) we know how frustrating this experience can
be for developers.

The main point you need to understand when dealing with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect is that they solve Federation - a problem
where you authenticate someone or authorize access by using a system you (within your company or when consuming third parties)
don't typically own. These protocols don't solve things like updating a user's profile, adding a secondary recovery email,
solving 2FA, storing and managing sessions, solving global logout. All of that is your responsibility, the protocols
simply offer a way to securely solve Federation over the Browser - they do not solve:

- Storage and management of all these tokens. Where do you store them? In the localStore? That makes them
vulnerable to XSS attacks! In a cookie issued by an HTTP server? You need to implement that!
- Managing and storing the user session. You need to create the cookie for the session, you need to delete that
cookie when the user logs out, and you need to make sure that the cookie implements secure best practices.
- You need to refresh tokens when they expire. That's easy for one request, but keeping those 15 concurrent
requests in sync? That's really difficult!

The list goes on. OAuth2 is hard. It has to be hard because the intended use case (again, "Facebook Photo Backups") is
very specific and several mechanisms need to be in place to deal with malicious third parties. But user login is not that,
and it does not have to be hard.

### Use a library

There are terrific libraries out there for solving most of the hard parts around identity. In fact, they are very similar
to how ORY Kratos was designed - the major difference being that ORY Kratos works for any programming language, not just
e.g. Ruby.

As your team scales, requirements change. Things need to scale (humans, servers, code), and you will slowly decouple
the original project into smaller, more manageable chunks. And here's where it get's tricky. Maybe the library
doesn't run on the newest version of your programming language. Maybe you decide to move away from the programming language
or framework as a whole. But your identity system is so interlinked with all of the source code (middlewares, annotations,
shared state, ...) - it becomes an absolute nightmare to decouple.

### Roll your own

You're very ambitious, we'll just leave you with some of the decisions we had to make:

- How do you manage changing user models?
- So do you use BCrypt, PBKDF2, Argon2, Scrypt, Argon2? Jesus, there's Argon2i, Argon2id, Argon2d now? And they
have different versions too?? And what the heck is a "Salt length parameter" and what's the most secure setting?
- If a user signs up via email, and later uses "Sign up with Google" that has the same email. What happens?
- If a user that's already signed up hits "Sign up with Google" (and vice versa), what happens?
- How do you prevent [account enumeration attacks](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_User_Enumeration_and_Guessable_User_Account_(OWASP-AT-002))?
- How do you implement 2FA? What happens if the user looses access to his/her device? Do you use a fallback Phone Number for
SMS? Or security codes?
- Do you know all of the important rules around sending (activation, welcome, ...) emails that don't alert spam filters?
- How do you notify Stripe when a new customer signs up?
- ...

That list is really, really long but you get the gist.

## ORY Kratos

You've made it! You should now have enough context to understand why we started ORY Kratos and why it's different and better.
The decision if that's really the case is, of course, ultimately yours - but here's why we think it is!

### Solving a specific problem domain

ORY Kratos solves a clearly defined problem domain:

- managing credentials (passwords, recovery email addresses, security questions, ...)
- authentication (secure login, keeping track of sessions and devices, ...)
- selfservice account management (update profile, add/update email addresses, changing passwords, ...)
- account/identity administration (create, delete, update, import, get)
- managing identity data (first name, last name, profile picture, birthday, ...)

If you need OAuth2 or OpenID Connect, you can use one of our other projects [ORY Hydra](http://github.com/ory/hydra). If
you need a permission system, you can use [ORY Keto](http://github.com/ory/keto).
If you need a Reverse Proxy, use [ORY Oathkeeper](http://github.com/ory/oathkeeper)

### Software Architecture

You've probably seen our [Software Architecture and Philosophy](../../ecosystem/software-architecture-philosophy.md) document,
but to re-iterate:

- ~15mb binary running on all operating systems without any system, library, or VM dependencies.
- ~15mb docker image.
- exactly one binary for the server and the cli.
- works best on Kubernetes and provides fast and easy to use [Helm charts](https://github.com/ory/k8s).
- easy horizontal scaling. No etcd or memcached or adjacent tool required.

### Bring your own User Interface (Framework)

We understand that most businesses have a unique interaction concept. Some companies need [progressive profiling](https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34155/how-to-capture-more-and-better-lead-intel-with-progressive-profiling.aspx)
and use a NodeJS app for that. Others want to capture everything in one go, using Client-Side JavaScript Framework like
Angular or React. Others want an iOS-native registration and login experience.

With ORY Kratos, we have defined flows that make it really easy for you to implement your custom user interface for
login, registration, profile management, account reset, ... - and equally easy to get started by using our reference
implementation [github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node).

For more details about each individual flow, head over to the [Self-Service Flows Chapter](../self-service/flows/index.md).

### Define your own Data Model

You may want to store more than one type of identity in your system:

- A customer that uses email + password to log in and needs to set his/her birthdate;
- A employee that uses a unique username + password to log in, with a cost center attached to their profile.

This is possible in ORY Kratos by using [JSON Schemas for Identity Traits](./identity-user-model.md)
