ORY Kratos does not support federation features itself, but it integrates with
projects like [ORY Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/hydra) that implement federation

Future releases of ORY Kratos will integrate with
[ORY Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/hydra) natively to support OAuth2 and OpenID
Connect use cases.
