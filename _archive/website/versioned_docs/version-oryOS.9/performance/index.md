Our ecosystem is not another over-hyped, oversold technology stack. Our
technology is truly built with 12 factor principles in mind, and the
technology's performance metrics are as good as it gets.

To prove this to you, we run an automated benchmark test suite **on every
product on every push to master** (well, almost - benchmarks for ORY Oathkeeper
and ORY Keto will follow soon). You can select the product you would like to
know more about from the navigation on the left.
